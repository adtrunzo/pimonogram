My program displays images onto the LED PI screen. It displays my first initial, A, for a second, it then removes
this initial and replaces it with my last name initial T. This also displays for a second before switching to a
display of a clover, which sticks around for a second before disappearing. 




Compile this using
cc -o adtrunzo adtrunzo.c -L ~/lib -I ~/include -lsense

call using ./adtrunzo









To compile and view on cisc210, add the flag '-lncurses' to the above.

Meanings of the flags:
-L ~/lib : Look for libraries in ~/lib (i.e., in the "lib" directory under my home)
-I ~/include : Look for extra header files in ~/include (i.e., the "include" directory in my home)
-lsense : link with the file libsense.a (you created this when you installed the sense library)
-lncurses : link also with "libcurses" (the "terminal graphics" library) from the standard library location
